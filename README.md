## // About
Using a raspberry pi and a generic webcam we can create a small device that can scan the road for vehicles, Using this data we can use image recognition to identify what kind of vehicle it is and add that to a database. we can calculate the average emissions from each vehicle type and evaluate the data with maps and GUIs.

## // How it will work
Using python we can use the library tensorFlow to allow real time image recognition to identify different vehicle types, We can add all this data to a local database and upload to a centralised database when connected to a internet connection which could either be a centralised service or de-centralised service.
